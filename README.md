# Maze_Solver

From scratch, I programming a primitive neural network that can solve mazes given by the user. The network is trained with a simple genetic algorithm. Using these networks, population of bots mutate their genes over time to solve a maze. Everything is written in java and custom windows were programmed to view the network and the genes of any bot in the population, as well as the bot currently running in the maze.
